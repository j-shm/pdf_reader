# Pdf reader and email sender

Used for fetching names and emails from pdfs and sending emails to them.
Not very useful without changing the code as it is for the style of pdf it is based upon, but can be used as a base for other projects.

## Setup and running

Install requirements

Put all pdfs in the same dir and run run.bat

You can use packer.py to put all the needed files in a zipped folder.
